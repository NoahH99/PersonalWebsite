  - text: One of Sergio's project is ActivityMixr, ActivityMixr is a dynamic website developed by Sergio's partner, Azure Dovel and him for their Application Development final project. Designed over the course of the semester, ActivityMixr allows the user to enter parameters for the kind of activity they would like to do, such as the number of people, cost, and type. The parameters are then sent to BoredAPI, a third party API that sends back an activity within those parameters. If the user likes said activity, they can then generate a playlist based off of their Spotify, and listen to said playlists which are saved over multiple sessions! Unfortantely, BoredAPI, the API they used to generate our activity, has been removed from the internet and is no longer functional. ActivityMixr makes use of CSS, JavaScript and Html.
